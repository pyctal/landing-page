# Landing Page

## Description

This project is a recreation of a landing page design provided by **The Odin Project**. The goal was to build a web page from scratch that closely matches a provided visual mockup and style guide, using custom HTML and CSS.

This assignment focuses on building layouts, positioning elements, and managing whitespace effectively without relying on frameworks.

## 🌟 Features

- **Header Section:** Includes a logo and navigation links aligned horizontally using Flexbox.
- **Hero Section:** Features a main headline, subtext, and a call-to-action button alongside a placeholder image.
- **Information Section:** A grid-style layout displaying four illustrated cards with subtext, centered and spaced evenly.
- **Quote Section:** A distinct content block with styled typography and background color.
- **Call to Action:** A centered modal-style box with a button.
- **Footer:** A sticky footer with copyright information.

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated

By completing this project, I have demonstrated proficiency in the following areas:

### 1. Advanced Flexbox Layouts

This project relies heavily on **Flexbox** to manage the layout structure. Key concepts applied include:

- **Flex Containers:** Using `display: flex` to create horizontal and vertical layouts.
- **Alignment & Justification:** Utilizing `justify-content` (center, space-between) and `align-items` to center content perfectly within sections.
- **Flex Direction:** Switching between `row` and `column` layouts to stack elements or spread them out.
- **Flex Wrap:** Ensuring content elements (like the information cards) behave correctly within their containers.

### 2. The Box Model & Spacing

- **Margins vs. Padding:** Extensive practice in deciding when to use padding (for internal spacing and background continuity) versus margin (for spacing between distinct sibling elements).
- **Sizing:** Managing `width`, `max-width`, and standardizing image sizes to ensure visual consistency across the page.

### 3. CSS Architecture

- **The Cascade:** Structuring CSS rules to ensure styles are applied correctly without unnecessary conflicts.
- **Class Naming:** Using descriptive class names for semantic HTML structure.
- **Typography & Colors:** Implementing a specific design system using appropriate Hex codes and font weights.
